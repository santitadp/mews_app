=================

Ruby Version 2.0.0

This MEWS App uses the Google Geocoding API, Google Maps Javascript API, and the Feedzilla API.
Top 10 world news taken from Feedzilla are visualized on maps using both Google APIs.

Each news category features 10 news. The categories are:
* General World News
* Politics
* Sports
* Science/Tech
* Entertainment

Some news from other categories may belong within other categories.
For example, one of the top 10 news from Entertainment, can also be the top 10 in General World News.
